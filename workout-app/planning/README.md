# Project Description:
The purpose of this app will be to allow users to create and keep track of their workouts, set goals for themselves to achieve, and stay motivated by listening to their favorite playlists through spotify. Users will create their workouts by adding lifts, the number of sets for each lift, the number of reps or amount of time for each set, and finally the weight and/or speed each set requires. Users will also also be able to set goals for themselves which can be anything from how much weight they want to gain or lose, a schedule for training to run a marathon, or simply a weekly schedule reminding them to workout along with an optional target date if the user would like to attain the goal by a certain time.

# MVP
Create a fully functional react app that allows users to create and store workouts and goals, with a node.js/express back end to remember user information. Also include a spotify API to allow users to listen to music while using the app. App will have full CRUD functionality. The app will also have the appearance of a professional website/app. I plan to implement Evergreen UI and an email submission form as my technologies not learned in class. 

# Stretch Goals
Allow users to see other users workouts
Add workout reminders to outlook or similar calendar application from app
Import Google maps to show user where nearby gyms are located
Allow users to upload progress photos onto their profile and/or goals page with a file uploader rather than a url
