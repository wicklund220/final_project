# Project Description:
The purpose of this app will be to allow users to create and keep track of their workouts, set goals for themselves to achieve, and stay motivated by listening to their favorite playlists through spotify. Users will create their workouts by adding lifts, the number of sets for each lift, the number of reps or amount of time for each set, and finally the weight and/or speed each set requires. Users will also also be able to set goals for themselves which can be anything from how much weight they want to gain or lose, a schedule for training to run a marathon, or simply a weekly schedule reminding them to workout along with an optional target date if the user would like to attain the goal by a certain time.
